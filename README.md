Smartphone Class Project

This Python project demonstrates object-oriented programming by creating a Smartphone class along with subclasses.
It explores concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and constructors.

âœ¨ Features

Base class: Smartphone with attributes like brand, model, and price.

Subclass: GamingPhone inherits from Smartphone and overrides methods (polymorphism).

Encapsulation: PhoneWithBattery uses a private attribute for battery life.

Constructors: Initialize objects with unique values.
